## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- SCSS
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I just learn how to use local storage, and never thought it was that easy! I also try to use SCSS for the first time, it helped me a lot to build the project faster. 

### Continued development

Still, I wanna master my React JS skill. Wanna give Next a try though!

### Useful resources

- [MDN Conditional Rendering](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Client-side_JavaScript_frameworks/React_interactivity_filtering_conditional_rendering) - I was stuck in the middle about how can I do the conditional rendering. This article helped me a lot. Thank you MDN!
